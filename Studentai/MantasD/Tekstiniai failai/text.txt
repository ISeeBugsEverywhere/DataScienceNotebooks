The Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO (IOC) is warning with 100 per cent certainty that a tsunami measuring over one metre will hit the Mediterranean in the next 30 years.
Spanish newspaper La Razon reports that the danger zone is the Averroes fault beneath the Alboran Sea - roughly halfway between the MÃ¡laga coast and north Africa.
An earthquake here could cause six-metre waves, which would reach Spain in as little as 21 minutes. In a best-case scenario, coastal residents would still only have 35 minutes to flee inland.
